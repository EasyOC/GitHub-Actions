            Stringified JSON array with the name of the type of machine(s) to run the workflow under, e.g.
            "[\"ubuntu-latest\"]" or "[\"ubuntu-latest\", \"windows-latest\"]".
      dotnet-version:
        required: false
        type: string
        default: 6.0.*
        description: Version of the .NET SDK to set up.
      build-directory:
        required: false
        type: string
        default: .
        description: Path to the directory where a solution file can be found.

        required: false
        type: string
        default: quiet
        description: Verbosity parameter for dotnet build.

        default: "true"
        description: >
          If set to "true", the NuGet packages will be cached by GitHub. This is faster if you have a lot of NuGet
          packages, but negligible or even slower if you only have a handful. In this case disable it by setting the
          input to "false".
      timeout-minutes:
        required: false
        type: number
        default: 360
        description: Configuration for the timeout-minutes parameter of the workflow. The 360 is GitHub's default.

  # While the below steps seem suitable to DRY with build-and-test-orchard-core, since reusable workflows can't call
  # other workflows, they'd need to be encapsulated in a composite action. That, however, will result in a single step
  # being shown under the build details with all below steps mushed together.
